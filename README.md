# Machine Learning Algorithms

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of several machine learning and reinforcement learning algorithms:

**Genetic Algorithms** – evolutionary optimization techniques used for solving search and optimization problems.

**Naive Bayes** – probabilistic models that classify data based on feature likelihoods, suitable for tabular or categorical data.

**Support Vector Machines (SVM)** – supervised learning models applied to both tabular and image datasets for classification tasks, including comparisons with deep learning methods.

**Reinforcement Learning** – agents trained to interact with environments such as Pong and Mountain Car, learning policies through rewards and penalties.

This repository provides a practical framework to experiment with different algorithms, compare their performance, and understand their strengths across various types of data.
